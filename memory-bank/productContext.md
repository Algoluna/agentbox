# Product Context

_This document explains why the project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals._

## Purpose
To provide a Kubernetes-native platform for deploying, managing, and scaling long-running, stateful AI agents with advanced capabilities such as LLM integration, vector memory, and persistent state.

## Problem Statement
Existing AI agent frameworks lack robust orchestration, lifecycle management, and integration with modern cloud-native infrastructure. There is a need for a platform that enables easy deployment, management, and observability of stateful agents, leveraging Kubernetes as the control plane.

## Solution Overview
The AI Agent Platform introduces:
- A custom Agent CRD for declarative agent definitions
- A Go-based Kubernetes operator to manage agent lifecycle
- A CLI tool for agent management
- Sample agent implementations
- Helm charts and scripts for streamlined deployment
- Future support for persistent state, vector memory, and advanced LLM/embedding integrations

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, declarative agent deployment and management
- Seamless integration with Kubernetes workflows
- Clear observability into agent status and lifecycle
- Extensible platform for advanced AI/ML use cases
- Easy onboarding for both platform engineers and agent developers

## Usage Scenarios
- Deploying a new AI agent with persistent state and LLM capabilities
- Managing agent lifecycle (launch, status, update) via CLI or dashboard
- Integrating custom agents into existing Kubernetes environments
- Observing and debugging agent behavior in production

## Alignment with Project Brief
This context directly supports the core requirements and goals by enabling Kubernetes-native orchestration, extensibility, and robust lifecycle management for AI agents, as outlined in the project brief.
