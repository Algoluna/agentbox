# Progress

_Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions._

## What Works
- agentctl CLI: build, deploy, logs, message, status, launch (all commands tested and functional)
- Helm chart: parameterized agent CR (agent.yaml), conditional infra (operator, Postgres, Valkey, secrets)
- scripts/deploy.sh: fully automated, uses agentctl for all agent lifecycle steps, robust multi-instance support
- test/test_cli.sh: uses agentctl for logs and messaging, validates agent lifecycle
- Helm multi-release/namespace and secret issues resolved (no more conflicts or stuck upgrades)
- Agent pod (hello-agent) is reliably created, reaches Running/Ready, and is fully operational
- Logs confirm successful Postgres/Valkey connections and agent main loop
- Multi-instance, multi-namespace agent deployment is supported and tested

## What's Left to Build
- Expand CLI/test coverage for new features as they are added
- Monitor for edge cases in multi-instance or multi-namespace workflows
- Continue to improve documentation and onboarding for new users

## Current Status
- End-to-end deployment, agent lifecycle, and testing are fully automated and robust
- All major platform features for agent deployment and management are complete
- CLI, Helm, and scripts are tightly integrated and reproducible

## Known Issues
- None blocking; all previous Helm, secret, and pod creation issues are resolved
- Continue to monitor for edge cases as new features are added

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Switched to parameterized Helm chart for agent CR creation
- Adopted conditional infra deployment for agent-only releases
- Integrated agentctl CLI into all deployment and test scripts
- Standardized on CLI-first, script-driven, reproducible workflows
- Early investment in automation and templating has paid off in reliability and developer productivity
