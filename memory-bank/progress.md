# Progress

_Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions._

## What Works

- **Simplified Agent Configuration**:
  - Standardized agent.yaml format with environment-specific configurations 
  - Convention over configuration with minimalist directory structure
  - Support for multiple environments (dev, microk8s, prod)
  - Environment-specific registries, clusters, and variables

- **Enhanced CLI**:
  - agentctl build with environment selection via --env flag
  - agentctl deploy with environment-specific configuration merging
  - Environment-specific image tagging and registry integration
  - Multi-cluster support for different environments

- **Documentation**: 
  - Updated READMEs for all agents with standardized format
  - Comprehensive examples for using environment-specific configurations
  - Main project README updated with new approach

- **Examples**:
  - Simplified example set with chatbot-router removed
  - chatbot-agent with LLM integration 
  - hello-agent with basic functionality

- **Agent CRD**:
  - Updated to support EnvironmentConfig in the agent specification
  - Standard format for all agent deployments
  - Clear separation between base and environment-specific settings

## What's Left to Build

- **Automated Testing**:
  - Tests for environment-specific deployments
  - Validation of environment merging logic
  - Multi-cluster deployment tests

- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Secret management per environment
  - Service discovery improvements
  - More granular environment configuration

- **Documentation**:
  - Tutorial for creating multi-environment agents
  - Best practices for production deployments
  - Expanded agentctl documentation

## Current Status

- Core platform is stable with improved configuration approach
- Agent examples demonstrate standardized structure
- CLI commands support environment-specific deployments
- Removed unnecessary complexity (chatbot-router)

## Known Issues

- May need to regenerate CRDs for the updated Agent definition
- Some older tests may not be updated for the new structure
- Need to verify all environment-specific variables are properly merged

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Simplification**:
  - Started with complex configurations across multiple files and directories
  - Moved to a simple, convention-driven approach with a single agent.yaml file
  - Eliminated the router pattern in favor of direct agent access
  - Reduced configuration complexity through standardization

- **Environment Support**:
  - Initially had different files for different environments
  - Now consolidate all environment configurations into a single file
  - More explicit, less magic in configuration

- **Developer Experience**:
  - Make the obvious thing easy and the complex thing possible
  - Convention over configuration for common tasks
  - Clear documentation of the simplified approach
